        <h2>how to survive your first day in Minecraft</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If you spawned in a plains biome(its ok if you spawned in a different biome), then chop down a tree to get wood. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Make sure to kill nearby animals for food, and kill sheep to eventually make a bed with 3 wool and planks.</li>
            <li>Open your inventory with the E key and put wood blocks into the crafting grid to make planks. <br>
            </li>
            <li>put 4 planks in to make a crafting table and 2 planks to make sticks.</li>
            <li>place down and open the crafting table and craft a wooden pickaxe, click the book to craft faster. </li>
            <li>find a nearby cave (be cautious of creepers and zombies) and mine the cobblestone, then make a stone pickaxe, sword, and axe. <br>
            </li>
            <li>mine 9 more cobblestone to make a furnace, then find coal and iron ore and mine it with your pickaxe.</li>
            <li>put coal at the bottom and iron at the top to smelt it. Use the iron to craft armor and tools. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Then you can craft a torch with coal and sticks, torches can prevent dangerous mobs from spawing.</li>
            <li>Finally, mine a lot of wood and craft a door with planks, then build your house. you can also craft a bed <br>
                to skip the night. If you don't have a bed, wait until daytime to kill sheep for wool. <br>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Once you complete these steps, then you could explore the world and find loot, or explore caves to find diamonds, <br>
            or you can build cool stuff.
