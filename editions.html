    <p>
        There are 2 editions to minecraft, bedrock, and java. <br>
        although they're both Minecraft, there is some differences between them.
    </p>
    <h2>Supported Devices</h2>
    <p>
        Minecraft java only supports Windows and mac devices, while bedrock can be played on windows, <br>
        console, and smart-phones.
    </p>
    <h2>Modding</h2>
    <p>
        There are a lot of mods on Minecraft java that can completely change the games look and gameplay. <br>
        However, Minecraft bedrock's modding is limited, and mods in the bedrock marketplace is paid.
    </p>
    <h2>Combat</h2>
    <p>
        Minecraft bedrock uses a simpler combat system, where you can swing your sword as fast as you want. <br>
        In java, you have to wait for your sword to cooldown, but axes are also stronger.
