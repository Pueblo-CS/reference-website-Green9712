    <h2>Java edition vs Bedrock edition</h2>

    <p>
        There are 2 main editions to minecraft, bedrock, and java (also education edition). <br>
        although they're both Minecraft, there is some differences between them.
    </p>
    <h2>Supported Devices</h2>
    <p>
        Minecraft java only supports Windows and mac devices, while bedrock can be played on windows, <br>
        console, and smart-phones.
    </p>
    <h2>Modding</h2>
    <p>
        There are a lot of mods on Minecraft java that can completely change the games look and gameplay. <br>
        However, Minecraft bedrock's modding is limited, and mods in the bedrock marketplace is paid.
    </p>
    <h2>Combat</h2>
    <p>
        Minecraft bedrock uses a simpler combat system, where you can swing your sword as fast as you want. <br>
        In java, you have to wait for your sword to cooldown, but axes are also stronger.
    </p>
    <h2>UI (user interface)</h2>
    <p>
        Bedrock's UI is bigger so its friendly to smartphone players, while java's ui is smaller, due to <br>
        it being only available to desktop devices.
    </p>
    <h2>which should I choose?</h2>
    <p>
        If you aren't on windows or mac, or you want to play with friends on different devices, <br>
        or you want a casual experience, then pick bedrock. However, if you want good modding support, <br>
        or all your friends have a pc, or you don't mind a harder combat system, and you're on windows or mac, then play java.
